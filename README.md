Conflux-pools is an application that lists the staking pools on the conflux network.
Conflux is a layer-1 blockchain, you can find all information about conflux here :
This application is not official and has not been created by the conflux team, but it has received a grant from them: https://forum.conflux.fun/t/conflux-pools-validators-list/13856/9

The code is open source and anyone can participate in improving it.
The purpose of this application is to centralise all the information concerning the different staking pools for securing the Conflux network.
Anyone can add their pool to the list, following the instructions below.

# Warning

This application is not affiliated with the pools and is therefore not responsible for lost/blocked tokens. As a reminder, here is a warning about staking on pools: https://forum.conflux.fun/t/pos-mining-pool-risk-warning/13760.
A check is made each time a pool is added to ensure that the information in the pool is correct, but we do not check the contracts.
Alerts are displayed on the application for pools whose contract has not been verified on conflux scan.
As a disclaimer, a verified contract does not mean that the contract is clean. We recommend that you read the contract yourself to be sure before you store your CFX on one of the pools.

## Add my pool

Anyone can add this pool, to do so you need to create a new pull request.
All static pools informations are in the **pools.json** file in.

The file contain a array with all existing pool, to add your pool you'll need 4 informations:

- The name of the pool
- The adress of the pool
- The image of the pool (icon display on the table, not mandatory)
- The link of the pool

Example :

    {
    "name": "Test Pool",
    "adress": "cfx:a77Hsb694ch9k2ppym6v68gzvy6yyUEYes3wndm7m",
    "image": "http://test-pools/favicon.ico",
    "link": "http://test-pools/"
    }

To add your pool you simply need to add your pools informations at the end of the file pools.json (in the array). If your pool is trsuted by the conflux team (the team will verify this information) you can add **"trusted": true** on the declaration of the configuration of your node.
That's it !
All others informations (APY, STAKER, TVL, ....) are directly fetch from the blockchain !
